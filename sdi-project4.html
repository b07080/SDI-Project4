<p>Creating this library was not an easy task.  Developing my own techniques and learning to think each problem through logically was the best part about this week's project.  I spent countless hours reading and researching trying to broaden my grasp and also to keep my coding simplified.
Using Komodo and Firebug are now my favorite debugging tools and perfect for someone just learning the basics.  I have come to realize that some sites that I have become dependent on are lacking in the direction of this course so I think I will take caution as I proceed.</p>
